#1 - Computer SYN 02 audio does not compute automatically - toggle
switch needs to be manually retriggered in order for audio to work.
#2 - Computer SYN 03 seems to not want to turn off (as soon as it is
    shut down it boots back up again).
#3 - On all computers the audio only comes out of the left channel
#4 - There seems to be a fair amount of noise (visual and audible)
    that is a result of the table lamps (and even when there is no light
    on at all) - is this something that can be eliminated with camera
    threshold parameters?

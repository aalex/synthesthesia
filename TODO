Installation-specific
---------------------
* Computer SYN 02 audio does not compute automatically - toggle switch needs to be manually retriggered in order for audio to work.
* Computer SYN 03 seems to not want to turn off (as soon as it is shut down it boots back up again).
* On all computers the audio only comes out of the left channel
* There seems to be a fair amount of noise (visual and audible) that is a result of the table lamps (and even when there is no light on at all) - is this something that can be eliminated with camera threshold parameters?

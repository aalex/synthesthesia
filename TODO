To do
=====

* add volume controls
* port the video analysis to OpenCV and GStreamer. (and maybe QT4)
* embed audio synthesis patches in libpd.
* use a faster protocol than FUDI to send the contents of the tables between the video analysis tool and the audio synthesis engine. (using libpd should solve this)
* create more instruments
* make the keystroke detection work at startup, without having to click in the GEM window. (moving away from GEM should solve this)
* use another instruments choice system, since we are limited to 10 choices right now. (numbers on the keyboard)
* create a web interface with Nodejs to control it?
